hello-world
===========

Obligitory to get use to git hub


README:

If you are reading this then I feel sorry for you.  There is NO need to read a README file for a "hello world" application. It is just sad. I mean really, what do you think it is going to say?

Okay, I will throw you a bone...

"Hello World"

Happy now? I hope that you read these files in the future, but on things that have some importance.
